# Simple Express.js Web App
Web app built with Express.js, Node.js, Jade templating engine, and Bootstrap for simple UI layout. 

The primary focus of this app is strictly for routing and parsing data using Jade templating engine and creating a functional contact form using node mailer. 

The front-end UI is not made to be pretty as it only uses a basic example Twitter Bootstrap theme.
